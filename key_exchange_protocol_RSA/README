JavaNumberGenerator and MillerRabbinTest - used for finding random prime number 
with given length and test it by Miller-Rabin primality test. 

RSA  - generates RSA key pair and stores secret key (d, p, q) and public key (e, n).
 
Also it allow create a programm to encrypt\decrypt messages, 
create and verify digital signatures.

So, the main idea is to create key exchange protocol with authentification
using RSA algorithm.
