	Standart Python generator ('random' library); 
	two of another are based  on linear shift registers;
	generate number from text;
	Blum Blum Shub generator.

So, for testing these generators there are 3 criterias:
	Probability criterion;
	Byte independence criterion;
	Uniform distribution criterion;
